# Experiments

This folder contains the experiments which were done in our paper. 
It is divided into four folders: data, tdlgm, dlgm, and rnn

_data_ contains the dataset which was used. It is not present here. Read the README-file in the folder to see where you can download it.

_tdlgm_ contains the code required for the tdlgm model. It should be possible to just run the notebook file and start training right away.
It contains both the recognition and state recognition model as two separate files. The generator is also its own file.

_dlgm_ contains the code required for the dlgm model. It should be possible to just run the notebook file and start training right away.
_rnn_ contains the code required for the rnn model. It should be possible to just run the notebook file and start training right away.
